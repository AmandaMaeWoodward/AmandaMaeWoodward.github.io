                  <p>Mentoring is one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. My mentoring style focuses on clear communication, 
                    helping my mentee develop professionally, and support. I focus on these three areas because I think they are 
                    important for helping my mentees to create and progress on their career path as well as for personal growth. </p>
                  <p>Clear communication between mentors and mentees stems from transparent expectations and regular contact. 
                    To accomplish these goals, I meet with research mentees at the beginning of each semester to discuss our 
                    expectations of each other and for our relationship. I start by explaining why it is important to discuss 
                    expectations and to offer some examples of expectations we can have of each other. Then, I ask my mentee to discuss 
                    some expectations they have for our relationship. After, Iâ€™ll introduce expectations they may not have thought of. 
                    At the end of each semester, we meet to discuss how our relationship has progressed and if there are things we need 
                    to alter. </p>
                  <p>Not all undergraduate research assistants are interested in pursuing research in graduate school or in their careers. 
                    I like to discuss potential career paths with mentees to figure out what skills will be most beneficial for them to learn.
                    For instance, some of my mentees have been interested in entering the medical field. These mentees focus time in lab working on
                    developing skills related to informing families about procedures and findings from research. Rather than focusing solely on 
                    experimental paradigm development, they focus on ways we can communicate our findings to the public and why informed consent 
                    is important. Outside of lab, we also discuss other experiences that may be beneficial for them and how to contact those who 
                    can help them develop medical skills, such as contacting a hospital to apply for a scribe position. </p>
                  <p>For those students who are interested in a career in research, or attending graduate school, I like to provide opportunities 
                    to be involved in presentations and publications. If a student is interested in these opportunities, I expect them to tell me 
                    as soon as possible so we can create a plan for them to conduct research that can be presented by them at an appropriate conference. 
                    Further, I like to make sure we discuss necessary commitments and expectations for them to be a coauthor on a study. The exact 
                    opportunity and expectation will be dependent on the study, but will generally involve writing a methods section, helping with 
                    analyses, and creating figures.  </p>
                  <p>     Finally, I see part of my job as a mentor as providing support. I think it is important for mentees to feel that they have
                    someone who will empathize with them and help them achieve goals that may seem daunting. For me, offering support involves being 
                    a cheerleader, a strategist, and a sounding board. As a cheerleader, I encourage students to reach for opportunities they are 
                    qualified for, but may not feel qualified for and echo their positive qualities. As a strategist, I help them think through back 
                    up plans and ways their experiences make them an effective candidate for a position. As a sounding board, I help them sort out 
                    their thoughts on next steps. If they are successful, I am there to help them celebrate. If they are unsuccessful, I try to help 
                    them reframe the experience as a learning opportunity and discuss next steps as helpful. </p>
